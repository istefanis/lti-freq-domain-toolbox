; variables used as counters, so as to have some metrics about the number of simplifications done:

(define simplifications-done 0)
(define algorithms-run 0)
(define algorithms-run-since-last-simplification 0)

(define (update-simplifications-counters!)
  (set! simplifications-done (+ simplifications-done 1))
  (set! algorithms-run-since-last-simplification 0))

(define (update-algorithms-run-counters!)
  (set! algorithms-run (+ algorithms-run 1))
  (set! algorithms-run-since-last-simplification 
        (+ algorithms-run-since-last-simplification 1)))

(define (zero-counters!)
  (set! simplifications-done 0)
  (set! algorithms-run 0)
  (set! algorithms-run-since-last-simplification 0))
